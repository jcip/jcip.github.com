    The last sentence on the page, about how <tt>synchronizedSet</tt> would prevent the error
    described in the preceding paragraphs, while technically correct, is misleading because

    for iteration in general.
    It only works because the <tt>toString</tt> implementation for <tt>SynchronizedSet</tt>
    acquires the lock before calling the underlying <tt>toString</tt> method.
